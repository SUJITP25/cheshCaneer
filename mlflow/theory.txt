MlFlow vs DVC 
DVC was allowing Versoning of Data, later added Experiment Training
MLFLOW is on a maturity level
DVC has to work parallely with the github 
MLFLOW doesn't have to do the same. 
DVC UI is not that good, MLFLow has a good UI. 
MLFLOW - Experiment Tracking, Visulization, Generative AI, Evaluation, Models, Model Registery, Serving 



Experiement vs Run 
You experiece with RF and someone is doing using Neural Network and the other One is doing Decison Tree 
You all play With Different Parameters. 
Experiment is a High Level Approach.
