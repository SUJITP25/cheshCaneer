create a project template by executimng template.py fiile 
write code at setup.py and pyproject.toml
create virtual environment and install dependencies using requiremets.txt 
pip install -r requirements.txt
setup mongodb and create username and password and connect to Database 
Upload data to the mongoDB Database using mongoDB_demo.ipynb file


step2 : 
write logger,exception code in file and test it in demo.py file 
notebook.ipynb and perform EDA in it. 



Data Ingestion 
(1) Write Python function/class to connect the Database,mongo_db_connection.py 
(2) in data_access folder in proj1_data.py access data as pandas dataframe
(3) Add code to config_entity.py  
(4) Make Training and Testing pipeline 



Data Validation 
(1) Add methods like load_yaml, read_yaml, load_object, save_object, load_numpy_array, save_numpy_array method in main_utils.py 
(2) Add Schema.yaml file in the config folder
